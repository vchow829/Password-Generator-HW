This assignment is very tough and was frustrating in the beginning. It still is frustrating but I made some progress. 

I know this is wrong because it doesn't function correctly but I think I have some aspects necessary such as console.log, math random, window prompts and confirm, etc.

I am currently uploading and submitting what I have before the deadline and will continue to work on this assignment.
